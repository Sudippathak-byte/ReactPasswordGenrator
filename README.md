Password Generator
This is a simple password generator built with React. It allows users to generate secure passwords with customizable length and character options (including numbers and special characters).

Features
Customizable Password Length: Set the password length between 6 and 100 characters.
Character Options: Include numbers and special characters in the password.
Clipboard Copy: Easily copy the generated password to the clipboard.


What I Have Used
useState: To manage the state of password settings and the generated password.
useCallback: To optimize performance for generating the password and copying it to the clipboard.
useEffect: To regenerate the password whenever settings are changed.
useRef: To interact with the password input field for copying to the clipboard.


Why I Made This
This project helped me:

Practice using React hooks (useState, useCallback, useEffect, and useRef).
Build a functional and interactive password generator.
Gain experience in building React apps with dynamic and user-driven content.
